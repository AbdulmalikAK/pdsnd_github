This document include 3 projects from data science nanodegree.

### ----------PROJECT 1 -------------
 
In this project, I query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. I was querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 


### -----------PROJECT 2 -------------

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

I was working on python code to answer the questions related to the BikeShare data system.


### ----------PROJECT 3 ----------------

In this section , i provide a piece of code related to AI project.
